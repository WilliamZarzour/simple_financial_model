To build a financial model, you will need to gather information about
	the startup's operating costs,
	sales projections and capital requirements,
	along with industry trends and competitive landscape.
You will need to consider factors such as
	market size,
	adoption rates,
	pricing and customer acquisition costs in your projections.
Additionally, you will need to perform a sensitivity analysis and risk assessment to assess downside scenarios and the potential return on investment.


Make assumptions based on industry research and benchmarks. Here are some potential sources of data for your analysis:

- Industry reports and market research from firms such as Gartner or Forrester may provide key insights into market size, adoption rates, and pricing trends in the technology industry.
- Competitor analysis reports can help you understand the startup's competitive landscape and benchmark its performance against other players in the industry.
- Customer surveys and user data can help you forecast customer acquisition costs, retention rates, and revenue per user.
- Management and executive team interviews can provide additional insights into the company's goals, strategy, and risk factors.

Keep in mind that the accuracy of your financial model will depend on the quality of your assumptions and the data you use in your analysis. Therefore, it's important to ensure that your sources of data are credible and reliable.

Assumptions:
- The startup has developed a new software product in the project management space.
- The startup is pre-revenue, but has 10 customers in its pilot phase.
- The startup plans to build a sales team to expand its customer base.
- The startup's product is priced at $100 per user per month.
- The startup has no debt and currently has $500,000 in cash reserves.
- The company plans to raise $5 million in seed capital to fund its growth and development.

Projection:
- Over the next five years, the company expects to acquire an additional 200 customers each year, resulting in 1,000 total customers by year 5.
- The annual churn rate is expected to be 10%.
- Sales team headcount is expected to double after year 3.
- Marginal costs for servicing each additional customer will be $25.
- Marketing and overhead expenses will remain relatively steady as a percentage of revenue.
- The company has a targeted profit margin of 25%.


example outputs
- Revenue projections from software sales, including organic growth from existing customers and new customers, and potential upsell opportunities.
- Expense projections, including sales team headcount, marketing and overhead expenses, marginal costs, and capital expenditures.
- EBITDA margin, which can be used as a proxy for the company's operating profitability.
- Net cash flow statement, which can help determine the company's cash burn rate and projected cash position.
- NPV or IRR, which can help determine the potential return on investment and whether the investment meets the firm's risk/return objectives.

To determine whether to invest or not, it's important to compare the results of your analysis against the firm's investment criteria, including its risk tolerance, target return, and investment horizon
